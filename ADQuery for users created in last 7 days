select  displayName,whenchanged, whencreated,(cast (whencreated as date)), givenname,sn,department,title , lower(rtrim(ltrim(givenname)) + '.' + rtrim(ltrim(replace(sn,'''','')))) as login
from  openquery(SWSVR14, '

where   objectClass = ''user''

')
where cast (whencreated as date) >=(cast (dateadd(day, -7,getdate())as date))


Need to do this on an an SQL instance with a linked server to SWSVR14 (replace with AD DC of choice)
Also could drop the whenchanged attribute as this seems to change regularly
